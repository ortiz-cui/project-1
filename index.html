    <p class="firstline">My name is Ryan Joshua Ortiz and I am the youngest of 4 brothers. I grew up in Whittier California.</p>
    <p class="secondline">I grew up going to Murphy Ranch and my hobbies as a kid were to go in the pool and play video games. It was only natural that when I went to Granada Middle School I joined water polo the year going into my 6th grade. I played at Admiral Water Polo and got third in Junior Olympics my first year playing. This spiraled me into a love for the sport. I continued to play water polo at La Serna Highschool. Eventually all of the years of work I put in lead me to coming to Concordia University Irvine to play the sport I love.</p>
